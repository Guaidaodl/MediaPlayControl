## Description
This is a very simple AutoHotkey script. Add some shortcut key to 
control volume and media play.

I just tested in Netease Music UWP and QQ Music UWP.

The default keymap is same as Mac :
- Alt + F7 previous song
- Alt + F8 play or pause
- Alt + F9 next song
- Alt + F10 volumn mute
- Alt + F11 volumn down
- Alt + F12 volumn up
